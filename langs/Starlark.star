# Starlark is a simple and predictable configuration language that is primarily used for writing configuration files and build scripts.
# It was developed by Google and is used in various Google projects, such as Bazel and Google Cloud Build.
# Starlark is designed to be human-readable, portable, and easy to understand, making it suitable for defining complex configurations and build rules.
